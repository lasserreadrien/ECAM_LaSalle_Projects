# ECAM_LaSalle_Projects
These are some of the projects I have done while studying at ECAM LaSalle, France.

## GarbageCollector Robot

This semester, the team works on Garbage collection with the help of a mobile robotic application. The goals are to use the robot, implement the autonomous navigation in an unknown environment and then allow the robot to work autonomously in such environment to complete its duties, removing trash from the floor and putting it in a safe and controlled environment such as a bin.

## MotionPlanning tutorial

The PRM (**Probabilistic RoadMaps**) procedure is divided in 2 phases: first, the map is built as represented in (a), and then a path is computed as represented in (b). The aim of this exercise is to implement a Matlab/Octave function that creates the map and then finds a path between a given start point and a goal point (in C-space i.e. joint space) avoiding collisions with obstacles (defined in the task space i.e. Cartesian space). You will then apply this function to the 2-link planar robot (whose features can be found in the appendix of this document) working in an area occupied by obstacles.

Same for **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)** 

## SIEMENS Tia Portal Training

I've worked on two practical works at ECAM LaSalle, with SIEMENS PLCs. Here are the corrected files, using Tia Portal v13.
